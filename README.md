###This project demonstrates the following:
---

1. Build a homepage for your local ice cream shop. 
2. Initialize and push/pull to a GitHub repository.
3. Regular commits and use proper semantic HTML tags.
4. Include 
  a. the shop's name
  b. a brief history (use lorem ipsum)
  c. a logo (any image you can find online)
  d. the store's hours and contact information
  e. flavors available (list at least 5 and no more than 42) with:
    1.name, calorie count, and whether it is sugar free or not
    2.a link to wikipedia for that flavor
5. See every other flavor on the menu alternate its background color (commonly called "zebra striping")
6. Restrictions:
  a. any libraries, extension, modules, or frameworks other than normalize.css and font-awesome
  flexbox
  b. animation - to be clear I’m talking about CSS3, canvas, and their ilk; you may use animated gifs, but keep them portfolio   professional if you do.
  c. tables for layout of anything other than actual tabular data (depending on your design the ice cream flavors, whether       they’re sugar free or not, and their calories may qualify as tabular data)
7. Use ```<aside>``` and CSS to create a left side-column with margins.
8. Mobile Responsive design
9. Social Media links
